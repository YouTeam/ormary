Too many people around the globe don’t have access to good education materials, or they are forced to learn through a system that doesn't properly cater to their individual needs. We think the technology exists today to fundamentally change this, and we're trying to build the tools and resources every student deserves.&lt;/p&gt;

We strive to hire the very best — people who are passionate, thoughtful and creative. We believe it is our obligation to relentlessly focus on what the learner values, and we make every decision with the learner in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

3.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We operate the Website as a platform for buyers like you to buy Products from Designers that sell on the Website.&amp;nbsp; We are not a retailer, a seller, an auctioneer, or any kind of agent or intermediary for you or any of the Designers (save where expressly stated below), and we do not sell the Products available through the Website.&amp;nbsp; We are not responsible for the Products, the sales, the Designers, or for any returns, guarantees, warranties or other after-sale care.&lt;br /&gt;
3.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;When you buy a Product on the Website you buy from the Designer direct, not from us, the Designer is responsible for the sale and any after sale care and our role is limited to acting as agent for the Designer to conclude the sale of a product by accepting on their behalf your offer to buy a Product and to receive your payment. Our receipt of full payment from you will discharge your debt to the Designer.&lt;br /&gt;
3.3&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Each sale forms a legally binding contract between you and the Designer and is subject to your usual statutory rights.&lt;br /&gt;
3.4&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Products from the following Designers&amp;nbsp; can be purchased on the Website.&lt;br /&gt;

5.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Your order constitutes an offer to the Designer(s) to buy a Product or Products. All orders are subject to acceptance.

&lt;strong&gt;7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;What if I am not happy with a product, if it is faulty or an order is late?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

7.4&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We are not responsible for any content on the Website from Designers. While we have taken reasonable steps to depict Products as accurately as possible through the photographs and other images featured on the Website, the detailing (such as colour, pattern and texture, etc.) you see on-screen will depend on your monitor and, as such, may not exactly reflect the actual detailing of a Product when you receive it.&lt;br /&gt;
